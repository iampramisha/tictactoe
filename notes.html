Yes, that's correct! When the edit button of player one is clicked, the `data-playerid` attribute in the HTML code is set to `1`, and this value is extracted using `event.target.dataset.playerid` within the JavaScript code.

The `event.target` refers to the element that triggered the event, which in this case is the clicked edit button. The `dataset` property allows access to the custom data attributes of an element.

In your HTML code, you have defined the `data-playerid` attribute on the edit buttons like this:

```html
<button type="button" class="btn" id="edit-player-1-btn" data-playerid="1">Edit Player 1</button>
<button type="button" class="btn" id="edit-player-2-btn" data-playerid="2">Edit Player 2</button>
```

The `data-playerid` attribute holds the identifier or index of the corresponding player. By using `event.target.dataset.playerid`, you can extract the value of the `data-playerid` attribute from the clicked button.

In the `OpenPlayerConfig` function, the line `editedPlayer = +event.target.dataset.playerid;` converts the extracted value to a number and assigns it to the `editedPlayer` variable.

So, when the edit button for player one is clicked, the `editedPlayer` variable will be assigned the value `1`, indicating that player one is being edited. Similarly, when the edit button for player two is clicked, the `editedPlayer` variable will be assigned the value `2`, indicating that player two is being edited.

By storing the `data-playerid` value in the `editedPlayer` variable, you can keep track of which player is currently being edited and perform the necessary operations on that player's data.
